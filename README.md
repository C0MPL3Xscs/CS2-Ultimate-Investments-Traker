# CS2-Ultimate-Investments-Traker

The CS2 Ultimate Investment Tracker is an application designed to help track investments and update investment portfolios. The app was created for personal use, but if you have basic understanding of Python, you can easily modify it to suit your needs. <br> <br>

The application utilizes the Chrome browser to navigate to the Steam inventory profile and, through web scraping, finds the necessary elements in the Steam Inventory Helper extension to track investments by pre selected categories.<br>

The app features a user interface with four buttons:

- Update Prices (Runs the main web scraping script)
- Open Steam Text (Opens a formatted text for the Steam textbox with the latest prices)
- Check Last Price Record (Opens a simple text with the latest prices)
- Information (Opens a new window with simple information about the app)

Please note that this type of app may violate the Steam Terms of Service, and it is recommended to use it at your own risk. <br> <br> It is also important to note that the code may not be optimized for temporal and space complexity, as the app was created for functionality rather than professional use.
